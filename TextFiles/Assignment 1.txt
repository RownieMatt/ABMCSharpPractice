Question 1: Write pseudo code that reads two numbers and multiplies them together and print
out their product.

Step 1: Choose a number for input A

input A = 1 (selecting)

Step 2: Choose a number for input B

input B = 2 (selecting)

Step 3: Add both input A and B

Sum = A + B

Step 4: Print Sum

Print Sum



Question 2: Write pseudo code that tells a user that the number they entered is not a 5 or a 6.

Step 1: Choose a number

input A = 7 (selecting)

Step 2: Check whether the number is 5 or 6

if(Input == 5||6)

Print Failure

Else 

Print Success

Step 3: What if the number is not 5 or 6?

if(Input != 5||6)

Print Input

Success

Question 3: Write pseudo code that performs the following: Ask a user to enter a number. If the
number is between 0 and 10, write the word blue. If the number is between 10 and 20, write the
word red. if the number is between 20 and 30, write the word green. If it is any other number,
write that it is not a correct color option.

Step 1: Select a number

input = 4 (selecting)

Step 2: If input number is between 0 and 10, print blue.

if(input >= 0 && input < 10)
	print "blue"

Step 3: If input number is between 10 and 20, print red.

else if(input >= 10 && input < 20)
	print "red"

Step 4: If input number is between 20 and 30, print green.

else if (input >= 20 && input <= 30)
	print "green"	

Step 4: If input number is less than 0 or more than 30, print "it is not a correct color option.

else
	print this "this is not a correct color option" 

Question 4: Write pseudo code to print all multiples of 5 between 1 and 100 (including both 1
and 100).

Step 1: print 1

print 1

step 2: count all the way up to 100

for i in range(1,100)

step 3: check if i modulo 5 is equal to 0, if it is, print i

if (i%5 == 0)
	print i

Question 5: Write pseudo code that will count all the even numbers up to a user defined
stopping point.
