For cooking food
Class recipe{
int ID;
string equipment;
string ingredient;
int ingredients;
time cooktime;
}


The problem is I need to cook food, so I will find a recipe online and cook the food in steps.

int ID for the food that I chose to cook,

string ingredient for what to put into the equipment,


Class StudentRegister{
int studentID;
string Name;
string Adress;
string EmailAdress;
string PhoneNumber;

getStudentAccount();
}

Library Record{
int LibraryID;
int StudentID;
string LibraryAdress;
string BooksBorrowed;
DateTime ReturnBookDate;

rentBook();
returnBook();
}
